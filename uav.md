# Intro
Talked about the different drone types and applications

# Physics:
## Different angles:
### torque
### inertia
### angular velocity & angular acceleration
### gyroscope effect 
### degrees of freedom
### criolis effect on rotational motion
so mostly the different effects and forces on the uav, and karman filter and problems of acc or gyro alone
